# Arena

## Introduction

This plugin, and the minigames that connect to it, will allow you to hold minigames in your custom-built arena. This plugin lets you select custom spawn points, will handle teleporting your players to and from the arena, and easily lets you plug in more Arena minigames.

## Requirements

+ Platform: Linux, Windows or Mac
+ [PlayRust](http://playrust.com/) server in its latest version
+ [Oxide](http://rustoxide.com/) <= 1.17 (and maybe latest)
+ Plugin: [Flags, Spawns](https://github.com/Foohx/Oxide-Arena/tree/master/require)

## Install

Put the plugin arena.lua well as flags.lua plugins and spawns.lua in the plugin folder of your server.
+ arena.lua
+ [require](https://github.com/Foohx/Oxide-Arena/tree/master/require)/flags.lua
+ [require](https://github.com/Foohx/Oxide-Arena/tree/master/require)/spawns.lua

You can also add one or more games, always in the same folder. For this look at the games available in [games/](https://github.com/Foohx/Oxide-Arena/tree/master/games)
